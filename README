📚 Overview

This tutorial investigates how L1 and L2 regularization improve the generalization of logistic regression models by controlling model complexity and reducing overfitting. Through clear explanations, formulas, and practical examples, it shows how each penalty affects weights, decision boundaries, and classification performance.

What You’ll Learn

🎯 Key Findings

The analysis in this tutorial highlights that:

L2 regularization (Ridge)

Produces smooth, proportional shrinkage of weights, keeping all features in the model with reduced magnitudes.

Offers strong stability, especially when features are correlated, and is suitable when all features may carry information.

L1 regularization (Lasso)

Drives many coefficients exactly to zero, performing automatic feature selection and yielding sparse, interpretable models.

Is effective when model simplicity and feature selection are priorities, or when many features are potentially irrelevant.

Elastic Net

Combines L1 and L2 to balance sparsity and stability, making it useful when features are correlated but interpretability still matters.

Hyperparameter Tuning

Proper scaling and cross‑validated tuning of λ are essential; too little regularization leads to overfitting, while too much causes underfitting and loss of predictive power.

🎨 Accessibility Features
